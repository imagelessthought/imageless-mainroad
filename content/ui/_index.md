## Understanding Open-Source Licensing Terms ##
You will find many resources online that you may want to include in your website: images, fonts, themes, templates, plug-ins etc... Before you use them in your website it is important to check the [licensing terms](https://opensource.org/licenses/ 'Open-Source Licenses') to confirm that your use is in compliance with the agreement.  You must follow any stipulations included in the agreement.  

When it comes to open-source resources, many of the licensing terms you will encounter grant you permission to use the resource pretty freely. But there are exceptions.  Before using anything you find online check:

- Is there a restriction on commerical use?
- Is attribution required?  If so - what does that entail?
- Not all open-source resources are *entirely free*: sometimes there is a free and pro version. The pro version will likely require a fee. Just because you can download it does not mean you are licensed to use it without payment. 

Also, for your own projects - always specify a license agreement.  

Here is some information on some popular open-source license agreements:

- [MIT Licenses](https://tlo.mit.edu/learn-about-intellectual-property/software-and-open-source-licensing/open-source-licensing 'MIT Licenses')
- [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/ 'Creative Commons')
- [Public Domain "Creative Commons Zero"](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ 'Public Domain CC0')
- [GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html 'GNU Licenses')

## Available Resources ##
Here are some resources that are available online that may be of use to you on your project:

### Fonts ###
When it comes to free and open-source fonts used on websites - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge 'Google Fonts') pretty much dominates. Google also offers icons (Material Symbols).  You may want to look at the [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto 'Noto Font by Google') fonts: it is intended to be a font that is available in all languages. 

- [Google Font Collection](https://fonts.google.com/ 'Google Fonts')
- [Google Icons (Material Symbols)](https://fonts.google.com/icons 'Google Material Symbols Icons')

### Images ###
If you are looking for images for your website, I would start with these:

- [UXWing](https://uxwing.com/ 'UXWING Free images'): A collection of free icons availabel for use on non-commercial *and* commercial projects without attribution. The collection contains well optimized free SVG and PNG icons that can be used on interface design, web and application development.
- [SVGRepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/ 'SVGRepo'): 500.000+ Open-licensed SVG Vector and Icons: Search, explore and edit the best-fitting free icons or vectors for your projects using a wide variety vector library. Download free SVG vectors and icons for commercial use. **Check the license terms carefully - some require attribution**.

The majority of the UXwing images are monochromatic (black on a transparent white background). The easiest way I have found to change the colors of an SVG file is to use this free tool: [DeEditor](https://deeditor.com/ 'Deeditor').

### Other Resources ###
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ 'Font Awesome') is a collection of fonts available in two versions: free and paid.  It is pretty popular and fairly easy to use.
