<p class="welcome-box">On the site you will find information intended for a wide audience: faculty researchers, students, and IT professionals. Articles, found under blog, are written by me and generally provide an introduction to a topic with everything needed to get started quickly. Posts may be tutorials, provide an introduction to a topic, or provide a description of an application or service and that includes related links.  Under documentation you will find step-by-step tutorials for various tasks.<br><br>
The main goal of the website is to provide a resource for colleagues and project collaborators.</p>
