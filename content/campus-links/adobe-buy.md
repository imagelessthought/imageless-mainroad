UNT offers <b>discounted personal education subscriptions to the Adobe Creative Cloud</b>: they are available for a one time purchase price of $50 (+$3 processing fee) and are valid until the end of the <em style="font-weight: 600">academic year</em>. Students without a subscription may access some of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications while using a computer in one of the on-premise classrooms or labs at no cost: cloud features and many applications are not available. These subscriptions allow students to use the Adobe Creative Cloud applications on any device: personally owned computers (home desktop or laptop), university desktop computers (labs and classrooms), laptops (university checkout) and the UNT Online Lab computers.
