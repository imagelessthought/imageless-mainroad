<p>Remote connections to Mac computers on the UNT campus are provided by Guacamole. Guacamole is an HTML 5 web application that allows users to make remote connections to MacOS computers using any modern web browser that supports HTML5. The computer endpoints are located on the UNT campus and are managed by UNT staff. You can connect and use a Mac from any device, regardless of the operating system. The interface is quite simple and intended to be as seamless and unobtrusive as possible. All software applications students need to complete their UNT courses are installed and updated regularly.</p>
<br>
<p>Guacamole can be used to provide remote access connections to any <b>Windows</b>, <b>Mac</b>, or <b>Linux</b> computer that is physically on campus.  If you would like your computer lab, research lab, or any other device added to Guacamole, please reach out to your local IT manager and we will work with them to get you set up.</p>
