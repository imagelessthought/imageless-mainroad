Our computer lab is available to all currently enrolled UNT students, in support of their academic programs. The mostly widely used software applications used by students are available, as well as software titles required by our students to complete arts and design related course work.

The computer lab staff is available to assist patrons in utilizing the equipment and services available and answer any questions. They are not permitted to assist a patron on their academic work.

CVAD faculty and staff will be provided access to the computer lab on a space-available basis. Priority will always be given to students. Once space is at a premium, faculty and staff may be required to vacate in order to allow access to a student.

## About our Computer Lab
Each patron may only be assigned to one computer at a time. Patrons may be assigned to a computer and an additional “non-computer” workspace simultaneously (i.e.: a computer and a 3D printer).

Each patron who enters the lab must sign in with the lab attendant, regardless of whether they are using a computer or piece of equipment. No patrons are allowed in the lab outside of posted lab hours.

## Policy Abuse ##
The Computer Lab Management has the authority to restrict lab access from any patron who abuses the policies set forth in the Computing Policies. Any member of the lab staff may inform patrons of policies that may be in violation and report such observations to the Manager.

If a patron is banned from the lab, the chair of the department for their chosen major may be notified.
