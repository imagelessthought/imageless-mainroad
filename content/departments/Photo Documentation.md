The Photo Documentation Service is open to CVAD students, faculty, and staff. Part of the function of the service is to create a database of student work that the university can pull from when creating promotional materials. Because of this, you will be required to sign a release to have your work photographed.

## About the Photo Documentation Service
To use the photo documentation room, you must schedule a 30-minute appointment. You can bring work of any kind, 2D or 3D. We will photograph no more than 5 pieces per appointment. If you have more pieces, feel free to schedule multiple appointments back-to-back.

We have cleats for hanging paintings on the wall, but other than that, we have no hanging or mounting supplies, so please bring your own. Please note that if your canvas stretcher has a beam in the center, it will not fit on a cleat.

After your session, we will have your photos ready for pick up in approximately two business days.

## Appointments ##
To schedule a time with a photographer, you will need to use our Reservation system. Chose the appointment that fits your schedule within the open times.

If you are unable to make an appointment during any of the available hours, you may check out a camera and lighting kits using our Equipment Checkout system.

## Equipment Use ##
Do not attempt to enter the Photo Documentation Room by knocking on the door without an appointment or by going in with someone else to have your work photographed.

Always have your student ID card with you – staff may ask to see your student ID card during your scheduled session.

You are not allowed to bring guests or visitors into the Photo Documentation Room without permission.

Only currently enrolled students in the College of Visual Arts & Design are allowed in the Photo Documentation room.

All users must leave the Photo Documentation Room at the end of their scheduled session.

Please comply with the requests of the Photo Documentation Room staff members at the end of your session and during emergencies (severe weather, fire alarms, power outage, etc.).

## Room Guidelines & Policies ##
Storage of supplies, equipment, props, and other personal items in the Photo Documentation Room before, during, or after your scheduled session is not allowed. If for any reason you need these items, please be prepared to bring and remove them during your session.

Users should never attempt to move, modify, repair, or borrow pedestals belonging to the Gallery without asking first.

Users cannot modify, subtract, or add items to the room that may damage the equipment or cause changes to the room’s environment.

If warranted, please consult with a Photo Documentation staff member for guidance about best practices and procedures in regard to photographing your work before scheduling a photography session.

The Photo Documentation staff reserve the right to terminate any photography session that causes undue disturbance and/or endangers the health and safety of the participants, staff, or the artist themselves.

The Photo Documentation Room is designated as a “dry” area. Please refrain from bringing works of art that have not had adequate time to dry to your scheduled photography session.

## User Consent ##
Students will fill out and sign the Permission to Use Artist's Work form and enter the titles and credit information for each of the works that will be photographed. The photographer must obtain the consent of any individual, including models, which will appear in or be the subject of the photograph.

## Handling Rules ##
The Photo Documentation staff will not hang, place, position or rotate artwork to be photographed. It is the responsibility of the user to handle the artwork and be present during the entire photography session. Cleats are mounted on the wall for the quick hanging of 2D works. Please use the appropriate cleat for the size of your work. Works up to 90x75 inches can be accommodated. Works on paper will be pinned to the wall.

## Sculptural Objects ##
The Photo Documentation room has a variety of digital light tents to document small and medium-sized objects. Larger objects will be photographed against a white backdrop. The user will need to make sure that large sculptural objects can fit through the door before a photography session is scheduled.

## Hallway ##
The hallway outside of The Photo Documentation room must always be kept clear. The user is not allowed to stage or store artwork, props, or pedestals in the hallway during a photography session.

## Images for the Artist/Designer ##
Students will receive photo files for their work that will be 11” on the long side, 300 dpi, with basic color correction as tiff files. Students will be able to pick up these files approximately 2 working days after the work is photographed. Students will need to bring a thumb drive or a removable hard drive to retrieve the files.
