The UNT campus is migrating from Drupal 7 to [Modern Campus, Omni CMS](https://moderncampus.com/resources/index.html 'Modern Campus and Omni CMS website'). This page is intended to provide the CVAD web migration team with the information they need to create the IT Services pages on the new website.
<!--more-->

In the past we have maintained a separate support-focused website for our users: the IT-support content that is presently on our [IT Services website](https://itservices.cvad.unt.edu 'CVAD ITservices Website') will be migrated to the new **UNT IT Helpdesk** (website not presently available).  The planning for the new IT Helpdesk website is underway and our current site **itservices.cvad.unt.edu** is likely to exist only as an internal resource (back-end, not hosting web-content) and for redirects after the migration. 

## UNT IT Helpdesk ##
A link will need to be on the CVAD website that directs our users to the UNT Helpdesk to report IT issues or make a request, each area will have a custom landing pages, however. I have setup a redirect that can be used for our link. Their is not an official logo at present, but the logos below are candiates I proposed that use the [current brand colors](https://identityguide.unt.edu/create-our-look/color 'UNT Branding Colors').  They are in **SVG** format.  You can edit the colors of an svg file using this [free website](https://deeditor.com/ "DeEditor: CVG Editor").

## CVAD Website ##
The new CVAD website will not contain IT support information, and will be marketting-focused.  As such *we will defer on all design-related decisions and will only provide assistance with the content for the page(s)*.  Below is list of the sections that will need to be included on the website: whether it is a single page with all of the information or separate pages - whatever is in line with the rest of the CVAD website will work for us as well.

> Content Sections: 
> * **Introduction**: Summary of Department.
> * **Service Desk**: Summary of the CVAD Service Desk and services available.
