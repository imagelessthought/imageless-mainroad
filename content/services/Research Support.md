Faculty research and student exhbition support is available beginning on the Monday following the 12th class day each term. If you are faculty researcher and would like to request assistance with a research project, please submit a ticket and we can schedule a time to work with you. Please provide a detailed description of your project so we can prepare for the meeting in advance: include a project description, an expected timeline and information on the technology that will be part of the project. Contact us as early in the planning stages as possible so we can allocate sufficient time in our schedule to assist you.
