If you have an on-campus event planned, in one of our buildings or elsewhere on campus, we can provide event planning and support for the event. We need sufficient lead time to prepare. Contact us early so we can make sure the space(s) you require will be available. If you are hosting an event off-campus, please contact the CVAD Service Desk to inquire about available services.

## Slideshows
One of the most common requests we receive for exhibitions and events is for slideshows to display images of student work or informational slides. You can find information on the service we provide for slideshows here.

## Service Details and Notes
If your event falls outside of the normal operating hours of our department, we can make someone available to provide technology support during your event if we have enough lead time to schedule someone.

We can provide laptops, projectors, cameras, and other devices you may require.

This can include helping prepare Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote presentations, or providing printed materials for the event. If you will be requesting printed materials, please ensure we have enough lead time: the printers we will use to print your materials are the same printers used by students to complete their course work and students are always given first priority on the equipment during the semester. During a semester there are high utilization times that may impact our ability to have your materials ready for your event.

Please do not ask a student to print your event materials in the Computer Lab: this prevents a student from working on their class assignment(s) and the printing counts against their personal print quota for the semester. You may contact the CVAD Service Desk to inquire about printing. Events must be approved by the College of Visual Arts and Design Leadership as there may be costs associated with the printing.
