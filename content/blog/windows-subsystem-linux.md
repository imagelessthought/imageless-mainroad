Over the past two years years Microsoft has made some significant improvements to the <b>Windows Subsystem for Linux</b>. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of the Windows operating system that enables you to run a Linux file system, along with Linux command-line tools and GUI apps, directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and apps. <b>WSL 2</b> is a new version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture, available beginning with Windows 10-Version 1903-Build 18362, that powers the Windows Subsystem for Linux to run ELF64 (Executable and Linkable Format) Linux binaries on Windows. WSL2 provides a truly great resource for developers and application testing.

The Windows Subsystem for Linux [(WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl 'Microsoft WSL') allows you to install virtually any Linux distro on your Windows 10 or 11 machine, without the need for a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup, and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly from Windows. You can install [multiple Linux distros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#ways-to-run-multiple-linux-distros-with-wsl 'Multiple Linux Distros on WSL2') such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, and Oracle Linux, and have them running at the same time.

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com 'Ubuntu Linux') is the default Linux distro in WSL, but you can [change the default distro that is installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distro-installed 'Change the Default Distro for WSL'). Ubuntu offers a set of [tutorials specifically for using the distro in WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl 'Ubuntu WSL Tutorials'). The tutorials are available as text and video.

WSL 2 is only available for Windows 10, Version 1903, Build 18362 or later.  If you are running a compatible version of Windows 10, you will need to [update your version of WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2 'Upgrade to WSL2'). Windows 11 was released with WSL 2 installed.

To get started, visit the [Microsoft website for WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about 'Microsoft WSL2 Website').
## Some improvements in WSL2:
* Uses a full Linux kerel.
* Support for full system call compatibility.
* Faster boot time and improved performance.
* GNU\Linux graphical applications can be run directly from Windows.
* Improved file system performance.
* Use GPU acceleration for machine learning and data science.

A thorough [comparison of WSL 1 and WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions 'Compare WSL1 and WSL 2') is available on the Microsoft website.

[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org 'The Linux Foundation') offers a [free training course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linux 'Free Linux Training') if you are new to Linux or need a refresher. [LinkedInLearning](https://itss.untsystem.edu/divisions/mrs/it-training/linkedin-learning.php 'LinkedInLearning') also offers several Linux tutorials.
