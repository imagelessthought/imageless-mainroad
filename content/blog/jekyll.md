[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ 'Jekyll Website') is a free and open source static site generator that was developed by Github and is written in the [Ruby Programming Lanaguage](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en 'Ruby Programming Language'). It takes text written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ 'Markdown Website'), [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki 'Liquid Website">Liquid'), HTML & CSS and uses standardized layouts to create static webpages. [SASS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/ 'SASS Website') integration is bulit-in. You can easily customize the look and feel, URLs, and the data displayed on your pages.

> Jekyll is the supported solution for webpages using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ 'Github Pages website').  The deployment workflow, using [Github Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/ 'Github Actions on the Jekyll Website'), is very well documented.

> The advantage to using static pages for your wesbite, from an information security perspective, is it decreases security risk: if there isn't a content management system - that is one less thing that can be exploited.  Tools such as the [jekyll-admin](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-admin 'Jekyll Admin Plugin"), and [jekyll-manage](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-manager, 'Jekyll Manager Plugin') provide an offline UI that makes updating and adding content simple. You just push your site once you have made updates.  [Github Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/, 'Github Actions') streamline the publishing of pages so that all is required is a simple *git push*.
