The AI field is heavy with jargon and terminology.  To help you navigate and understand the the technologies and solutions that are out there, you will need a some help. I suggest starting by reading this article: [Artificial Intelligence Glossary: Neural Networks and Other Terms Explained](https://www.nytimes.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-glossary.html 'NYTimes') - New York Times; March 23, 2023.

Below are links to some glossaries and articles to further assist you with the terminology.
