Our college uses [Microsoft Teams](https://itservices.cvad.unt.edu/online-servicedesk/ 'OSD') to provide an **online service desk** to our students, instructors, and staff.  Physical visits to our service desk are rarely required as we can begin a remote session to help with any hardware or software issues - including new software installation.  We can begin a remote session with you regardless of whether you are on campus, working at home, or travelling in a foreign country as long as your device is connected to the internet.

Use the link above to connect to the **College of Visual Arts and Design** Online Service Desk. 

You may also contact us by submitting a ServiceNow [ticket](https://itservices.cvad.unt.edu/support/ 'Ticket'), sending an [email](mailto:cvad.itservices@unt.edu 'Email') or by [phone](tel:9405654522 'Phone').  Please contact us if you have any questions, would like to make a request, or need to report an issue.
