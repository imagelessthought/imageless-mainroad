      <description>What is Generative AI? Introduction Generative AI is changing how we create. (light music) For the first time, humans are supervising and machines are generating. It&amp;rsquo;s helping us lift the dirty, dull, dangerous and difficult tasks from humanity&amp;rsquo;s shoulders so then we can simply focus on the very essence of our work, the vision, the idea, and the purpose. It&amp;rsquo;s a complete paradigm shift for the future of jobs. I am Pinar Seyhan Demirdag and I&amp;rsquo;m the co-founder and the AI director of Seyhan Lee.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of Python programming! This tutorial is designed for undergraduate students who may not have a background in computer science but want to learn the basics of Python. Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that has gained widespread popularity for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility. Python is beginner-friendly and widely used in various fields, including data science, web development, and automation. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, with the goal of making programming accessible and enjoyable. Named after the British comedy group Monty Python, the language has evolved into a dynamic and user-friendly tool used across various domains of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Universal Digital Signage&lt;/strong&gt; web application provides a centralized digital signage solution. Images can be uploaded to the server and playlists created online.  Playlists can be assigned to individual digital signs (&lt;strong&gt;hosts&lt;/strong&gt;) or signs can be managed in groups. Playlist changes can be performed on a schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly schedules) with an option to add an &lt;em&gt;interrupt&lt;/em&gt; schedule change (a temporary change set for a given period of time after which the sign or group reverts back to its normal schedule).  There is also the option to assign playlists to &lt;strong&gt;channels&lt;/strong&gt; to provide slideshows for other use cases (such as screensavers, external groups, or anythng where a slideshow is needed), &lt;strong&gt;interactive kiosks&lt;/strong&gt;, and hosted online &lt;strong&gt;presentations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The signage solution we have in place has served us well but it is time for an update. The original open source developer of the solution has taken their project proprietary as well. We will be developing the new solution as open source and will use already available code whenever possible: don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.  Unless you have to, that is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years years Microsoft has made some significant improvements to the &lt;b&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/b&gt;. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of the Windows operating system that enables you to run a Linux file system, along with Linux command-line tools and GUI apps, directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and apps. &lt;b&gt;WSL 2&lt;/b&gt; is a new version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture, available beginning with Windows 10-Version 1903-Build 18362, that powers the Windows Subsystem for Linux to run ELF64 (Executable and Linkable Format) Linux binaries on Windows. WSL2 provides a truly great resource for developers and application testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
