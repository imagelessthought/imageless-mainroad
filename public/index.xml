      <description>Description: This will be a device independent solution: the only configuration of the devices and screensavers that should be required is a URL to the server.. The server will host the content in playlists using one of the available templates. The digital signage device will simply need to launch a browser in full-screen mode and open the URL at startup: the URL will be the server. and the hostname of the device example: https://signage.</description>

      <description>Understanding Open-Source Licensing Terms You will find many resources online that you may want to include in your website: images, fonts, themes, templates, plug-ins etc&amp;hellip; Before you use them in your website it is important to check the licensing terms to confirm that your use is in compliance with the agreement. You must follow any stipulations included in the agreement.
When it comes to open-source resources, many of the licensing terms you will encounter grant you permission to use the resource pretty freely.</description>
