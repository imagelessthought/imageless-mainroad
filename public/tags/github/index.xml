      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com&#34; title=&#34;Git Website&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git has been around since 2005 and is widely used for collaborative software development.  But it has wider uses.  As examples it is used by writers and artists to track changes as it keeps a complete history and changes can be rolled back to any point.  You can grant access to your projects and allow others to submit changes: those changes can be reviewed by the owner and merged, rejected, or a separate branch created.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
