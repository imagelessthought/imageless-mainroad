      <description>Below is the information on the various training and certifications I have completed. I complete training using a variety of vendors, my preferred training vendors are: Coursera (used for my Google and IBM certifications), Stormwind Studios (used for Microsoft and other proprietary software training), ACI Learning (used for open source and new technology training), W3 Schools (provides training certifications that are primarily focused on web technologies and not tied to a specific product), and finally LinkedIN-Learning (provides a wide range of technical and business-related certifications).</description>
