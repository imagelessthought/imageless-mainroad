This tutorial is designed for undergraduate students who may not have a background in computer science but want to learn the basics of Python. Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that has gained widespread popularity for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility. Python is beginner-friendly and widely used in various fields, including data science, web development, and automation. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, with the goal of making programming accessible and enjoyable.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YAML, short for &amp;ldquo;YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language&amp;rdquo; or sometimes &amp;ldquo;Yet Another Markup Language,&amp;rdquo; is a human-readable data serialization format. It is often used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures. YAML files use indentation and colons to denote structure, making them easy to read and write.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
