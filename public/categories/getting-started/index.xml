      <description>Over the past two years years Microsoft has made some significant improvements to the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of the Windows operating system that enables you to run a Linux file system, along with Linux command-line tools and GUI apps, directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and apps. WSL 2 is a new version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux architecture, available beginning with Windows 10-Version 1903-Build 18362, that powers the Windows Subsystem for Linux to run ELF64 (Executable and Linkable Format) Linux binaries on Windows.</description>
