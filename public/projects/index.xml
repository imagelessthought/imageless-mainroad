      <description>The content in this article was created from my notes from the certification course, Career Essentials in Generative AI by Microsoft and LinkedIn with summarization and revisions performed using Microsoft Copilot.
Introduction What is Generative AI? Generative AI is changing how we create. (light music) For the first time, humans are supervising and machines are generating. It&amp;rsquo;s helping us lift the dirty, dull, dangerous and difficult tasks from humanity&amp;rsquo;s shoulders so then we can simply focus on the very essence of our work, the vision, the idea, and the purpose.</description>

      <description>Description: This will be a device independent solution: the only configuration of the devices and screensavers that should be required is a URL to the server.. The server will host the content in playlists using one of the available templates. The digital signage device will simply need to launch a browser in full-screen mode and open the URL at startup: the URL will be the server. and the hostname of the device example: https://signage.</description>

You must follow any stipulations included in the agreement.
When it comes to open-source resources, many of the licensing terms you will encounter grant you permission to use the resource pretty freely.</description>
